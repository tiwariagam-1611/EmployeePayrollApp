Employee Payroll App

Goal: Develop an Employee Payroll Management System that demonstrates Object-Oriented 
Programming concepts in real-world enterprise application development.
Description: The app shows how encapsulation, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, 
and exception handling solve business problems while ensuring scalability and maintainability.

UC1: Employee Registration  
Goal: Register a new employee with validated personal and salary information.
Description: Uses encapsulation, constructor overloading, and RegEx validation to ensure data integrity. Combines Employee and UserAccount objects for secure credential storage and returns confirmation.

UC2: Employee Authentication & Login
